        <p>
          We were withheld, not banned. ClickCrystals project on Modrinth is
          withheld due to the presence of unfair advantages.

          Incompatibility. <br />The new versions of ClickCrystals has a new
          feature called Discord RPC. This essentially displays your acitivies
          on discord presence. Because the API that we use only supports Linux
          and Windows, ClickCrystals has become incompatible with MacOS and
          Pojav. <br />Here's how you can solve this:
        </p>
        <p>Get off Mac</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ClickCrystals is not compatible with MacOS.</li>
          <li>
            If you have enough money to afford a MacOS, with the same money you
            could buy a real computer 10x better. Apple is a scam and you should
            hop off.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Get a real PC</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why play Java on phone? It's incompatible now!</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="question">
        <div class="title">
          Is this mod safe? Is this a rat? Is this a vius?
        </div>
        <p>
          In around May of 2023, our mod ClickCrystals, developed by
          ImproperIssues (aka ItziSpyder), has been stolen by a person with the
          alias of L0rax or Niksa_. This person proceeded to inject malicious
          code that grabs your Microsoft account, Skyblock information, and IP
          then sends them to a Discord webhook.
        </p>
        <p>
          L0rax has commited identity theft and advertised ClickCrystals as his
          own mod on CurseForge. Luckily, after a few months of fighting, the
          duplicate mod was taken down and the webhook was nuked and destroyed.
          7 months later, we have decided that the situation on CurseForge has
          calmed down enough for us to reupload our mod to the site.

          Please refrain from downloading ClickCrystals from any link other than
          the ones provided in the downloads Tab up top of the page. Do not
          accept random files from strangers or websites that you do not trust.

      <div class="question">
        <div class="title">What is ClickCrystals Script? How do I use it?</div>
        <p>
          ClickCrystals script is an in-game custom module maker. The script
          allows you to create custom modules similarly in a way you would
          create datapacks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <div class="title">How do I download ClickCrystals?</div>
        <p>Click on the download Tab on top of this screen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <div class="title">Is this cheating?</div>
        <p>Short answer, no.</p>
        <p>
          Long answer, it is not a cheat. It does not automate any task, for
          every action the mod preforms, you have to click or interact with
          something. The definition of macro is doing a task without the player
          inputting anything. This is false. Unless a player creates a macro
          with ClickCrystals script, the mod itself does not provide any unfair
          advantages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <div class="title">Will I be banned? Is this bannable?</div>
        <p>
          While we believe ClickCrystals doesn't provide any unfair game
          advantages, the world does not. Servers WILL ban you if they find out
          you are using this mod. Best way to prevent this from happening is to
          not get screenshared. We have provided multiple approaches to this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The mod does not flag anticheat</li>
          <li>The mod looks like normal gameplay in third person view</li>
          <li>
            The mod, unless errors and stacktraces, has its own custom log file
            seperate from the vanilla one; can be easily deleted
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you still possess older versions of ClickCrystals, you may have
          heard of the command !cc -users. This command was once added as a fun
          easter egg, which has later caused a disaster leading to its removal
          in later versions. Servers can use this to force ban you, be sure to
          update your version!

        <div class="title">How to open menu?</div>
        <p>
          Apostrophe key. If you don't know what it is, you're a third grader
          that shouldn't be play games and should be studying instead.
